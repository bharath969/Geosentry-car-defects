## Features
- Automated Defect Detection: Identifies paint damage, cracks, and dents in vehicle images.

- YOLO Model: Utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm for fast and efficient predictions.

- Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces: Easily accessible via the web without requiring local installation.

- User-Friendly Interface: Upload an image and get instant defect detection results.
